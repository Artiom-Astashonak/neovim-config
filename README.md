# neovim config
This is my neovim configuration I try to make cooler and best every 4-6 months. You can download it and see how my workspace is organized and take something to yourself.

The plugins I use in my configuration:
1. [onedark](https://github.com/navarasu/onedark.nvim) - colorscheme for neovim with simple and cool colors that doesn't make your eyes blow up after a few hours of work.
2. [treesitter](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter) - set of parses for all programming languages that ensures your colorscheme does detect right tokens.
3. [telescope](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim) - fast and furious file search from the project folder.
4. [lualine](https://github.com/nvim-lualine/lualine.nvim) - custom status bar on the bottom of the buffer.
5. [neotree](https://github.com/nvim-neo-tree/neo-tree.nvim) - simple yet powerful file manager right in neovim.
6. [mason](https://github.com/williamboman/mason.nvim) [mason-lspconfig](https://github.com/williamboman/mason-lspconfig.nvim) [nvim-lspconfig](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig) - set of plugins to enable language server features inside neovim.
7. [nvim-cmp](https://github.com/hrsh7th/cmp-nvim-lsp) [cmp-nvim-lsp](hrsh7th/nvim-cmp) - completion UI clients and completion engines that can utilize the communication between the language servers and neovim to provide autocompletions and snippets for better coding.
